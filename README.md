# Skip Selection Page Redesign Challenge â€“ Approach & Rationale

## Overview

In response to the challenge instruction to redesign the skip selection page, I approached the task with a strong emphasis on clean, maintainable code, responsive layouts, and modern UI/UX principles. My primary objective was to deliver a user experience that is visually appealing, intuitive, and seamless across all devices.

I began by outlining key points that would enhance the user experience. Drawing inspiration from contemporary design patterns and after a period of brainstorming, I created an initial wireframe to guide the redesign process.

## Design Goals

- **Clarity:**  
  Present skip sizes, prices, and restrictions in a way that allows users to compare options at a glance.

- **Responsiveness:**  
  Ensure the layout adapts fluidly to all screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops.

- **Component-Based Organization:**  
  Structure the codebase using reusable, well-organized React components for scalability and maintainability.

- **Modern Aesthetics:**  
  Incorporate gradients, rounded corners, and subtle shadows to achieve a clean and professional appearance.

- **Accessibility:**  
  Provide clear feedback for all interactive elements, maintain high color contrast, and ensure the interface is usable for all users.

- **Guided Flow:**  
  Implement a progress indicator to help users understand their current stage in the booking process and what steps remain.

- **Distinct Visual Identity:**  
  Create a visual design that is a clear departure from the original page, establishing a unique and modern look.
